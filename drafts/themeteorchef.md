How do I solve that with Meteor? For developers like us, this question may happen under the hood more often that we would like! 

But thankfully [The Meteor Chef](http://themeteorchef.com), TMC, teaches you how to solve-day-to-day problems in your Meteor applications. Yeah!

### Cook Meteor with the Chef

The main part of [TMC](http://themeteorchef.com) is a blog updated 3 times a week with three kinds of article:  recipes, snippets and blog articles.

###### Recipes
The recipes are in-depths tutorials that help you implement features, from [building a chat application](https://themeteorchef.com/recipes/building-a-chat-application) (brand new one with Meteor 1.3, yeah!) to [accepting payments with Stripe checkout](https://themeteorchef.com/recipes/payments-with-stripe-checkout) or even [building a blog with React](https://themeteorchef.com/recipes/building-a-blog-with-react/). 

A recipe is focused on *building a small project*, and the Chef explains you with his unique and enjoyable style the different pain points and why we are doing things like this. It usually takes 1 to 3 hours to complete a tutorial. 

You don't need to start from scratch, all recipes start with [Base](https://themeteorchef.com/base/), a boilerplate designed for getting new projects up and running as quickly as possible.

###### Snippets
TMC provides also a collection of small code snippets to allow us, developers to solve frequently occuring problems in a breeze!
At the time of writing there are 54 snippets already! Wow! Next time you have a problem it might be a good idea to have a look in the meteor chef snippet database!

And as always, the snippets are really well explained, answering the problem step by step, including the starting point, client side code, server side code. All the information is smoothly structured, wrapped up by TMC with some takeaways for you to take back home with what you learned hacking with the snippet. What else? 

###### Blog
Blog articles tagged Blog are blog posts (mmmh... meta?) about updates and fun stuff from TMC. It's still in the context of *learning Meteor* with a wider scope than the two other categories.

It provides a quality read which invites to reflexion or reaction about developer life, blogging, the future of Meteor. 

If you are into writing & Meteor, don't hesitate to contact Ryan Glover, also known as The Meteor Chef, he recently [called for authors to contribute](https://themeteorchef.com/blog/call-for-authors/)!

###### Weekly digest
And moreover, cause you may not be into connecting to a website every day to see if their some fresh news. What? Facebook? No, no, that's not my point, let's forget that. Whatever, TMC run a weekly digest sent by email on Friday. 

It gives hints on what you can ~~cook~~ learn this week, it's worth the subscription!  

### Share your tasty dishes
Coding itself is cool. Sharing piece of codes or experiences with others is cool & useful. TMC is not just a website: it has a learning philosophy.

In almost every TMC's post, you'll find this: 
>If you get confused or stuck while reading - or just want to talk about Meteor - join us on Slack! [Get an invite now](http://slack.themeteorchef.com/).

Cause yeah, hanging out with other developers in a Slack room can both boost your learning curve and provide fun! You can help people or ask for help on your issues and get in touch with interesting folks you would otherwise never meet. Give it a try, make your own opinion about it and beware of not being overwhelmed by the huge amount of messages!

If you need paid-coaching, have a look on the [Chef's table page](http://) and ask for help directly to the Chef. In November, Ryan [introduced the Chef's table](https://themeteorchef.com/blog/introducing-chefs-table/): people reading TMC were sending request for coaching service on Meteor. So he opened slots for "two hour, 1-on-1 coaching session with him where we can discuss anything Meteor-related".
