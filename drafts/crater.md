Even though [the goal is to learn](http://hacklearnmake.com/stoked-on-meteor-the-goal-is-to-learn/), one wise advice I was given some day has been to not trying to know everything and filter what you want to learn to get the best and avoid well-known [Javascript Fatigue](https://medium.com/@ericclemmons/javascript-fatigue-48d4011b6fc4).

### Where real-time web & mobile dev news lands
[Crater.io](https://crater.io) is a *HackerNews-like* web app built with [Telescope](http://www.telescopeapp.org), one of the biggest open-source app made with Meteor. It has been curating more than 700 Meteor news for 2 years and has been gathering an engaged community of fans keeping the content's quality at a high level.

You can upvote the news you like, share interesting articles you found around the Web or promote your project to get feedback from the community!

> My hope is that we can all learn and find ways to build great apps, even if that leads you outside of Meteor.

Since December 2015, [Josh Owens](https://twitter.com/joshowens), creator of Crater, has broadened the feed to non-Meteor related articles. And that's cool! If you are curious, you can dive with pleasure in articles you may not have found unless going there.

Like the Medium digest, you can subscribe to the daily digest to get in your inbox every morning what happened on Crater lately. 

### Don't want to take the time to read? 
No worries, you can listen too! [Josh](https://twitter.com/joshowens) with regular co-hosts like [Ben Strahan](https://twitter.com/_benstr) (who's just released [his last show](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvsrEeDnq_E)!), [Abhi Aiyer](https://twitter.com/abhiaiyer/) or [Ry Walker](https://twitter.com/rywalker), host a weekly podcast to discuss Javascript news and especially the best and most interesting Crater posts this week.

It's a lot of fun to listen to them and they know how to lead their hangout during 40 minutes: they have been doing more than 90 editions by the time I'm writing this article. 

Easy to follow, you can listen to it on [iTunes](https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/the-crater-podcast/id795089333) and direct download on [the official page](http://podcast.crater.io/), and follow the [Twitter feed](https://twitter.com/craterpodcast). If you prefer to watch moving lips, you can even watch the discussion on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLtujUkEY1JlpuZlZRinJkJOgkiPKDFUnS).

### Conference landing at your desk
Snacks prepared. Ready to learn live great content. Last but not least in the Crater world, a remote conference about Javascript, Meteor and React was hosted this February on CrowdCast during 3 days with 12 different speakers, among them MDG members and Meteor community engines.

In a relaxed way, you would be explained by experts many different subjects, from Reactive UI techniques to hacking Meteor with [Pete Corey](http://east5th.co) or understanding the choice of [Arunoda](https://twitter.com/arunoda) to deal with GraphQL. You could ask questions lively and being answered at the end of the talk. 

Like a short MOOC, but a lot better, you can find the talks on [SpaceDojo's Youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLtujUkEY1JlqE6KsIbQeShY3gLEylKnrr). I highly recommend to have a look, it's a gold mine of information!

### Q&A with Josh Owens
###### Crater's dad

> « Ask Me Anything » sessions on Crater.io are engaging. Are regular editions expectable in the future?

That is my goal with the AMA’s going forward on Crater. It is a lot of time and effort to think up who to ask and to get them to commit. I really want to get the site updated to React/Nova branch of Telescope before I push it more. Also, would love some help in that regard, getting people lined up and going, etc

> In which direction are heading the next 100 editions of Crater Podcast?

I’m not sure the direction will change a lot, but I plan to talk to Abhi and we are always open to ideas. I just hope our listener base enjoys the podcast and continues to listen and we keep growing on that front.

> When and on what subjects will be the next Crater Conf?

The next Crater Conf is July 13th-15th, 2016 and will cover mobile topics like React Native, Cordova, building mobile apps with Meteor, etc.
