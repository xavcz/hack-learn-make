*Disclaimer:* I work as [consultant webdeveloper](http://xav.cz), and I help early stage startups building remarkable products for targeted customers.

### Learn by doing, not thinking
As an early stage startup, you should act upon two cycles: **customer development** and **product development**. In simpler words, meet your customers and work on your product. Customer development and product development lead to feedbacks, and then... well, rerun these cycles! So you'll be right or wrong faster

I remember one wise mentor at [Startup42](http://hacklearnmake.com/startup42-from-hackers-to-founders/) asking the startups there:
> Are you a product or a company? 

The company is the structure around the product, **the company makes the product lives**. So if you don't want to build a company around your product, that's fine, this is called [a side-project](https://github.com/xavcz).

Otherwise, you should focus on the right things. Oooh, buzzword! You may have heard it a lot before: 
> Be focus! 

>If you loose focus, you loose energy... and then you die.

### What is the focus?
Focus is different from concentration. It's about being intense, spending the highest level of intensity, energy, in what matters for your (wannabe) business: tasks which provide growth. Before the so-called "Product-Market Fit", your focus should be "understand your customers" & "design your product". And nothing else.

I believe that **focusing on the right things at the right moment is critical**. I invite you to read this excellent article by [Oussama Ammar](https://salon.thefamily.co/stay-focus-b5de376b1359), partner at [TheFamily](http://thefamily.co).

### Make your startup have a life
As Oussama says well, your most important metrics are the life metrics. The metrics which tells you if you are [dead or alive](http://deadoralive.xav.cz).
> The life metrics are the most important, and for 99% of companies, they come down to revenue.

So, for god sake, generate income and create value for your users. And then reinvest this money in your product to make it even better.

### Side-project are cool too

There is no shame about building side-projects. But you have to be crystal clear that it is not a business.

Here is one of mine: [Dead or Alive](http://deadoralive.xav.cz).

Are you willing to face the truth or not considering your business state? I build a one-task tool that I give to my clients, and you may want to give it a try ;)

This project has been my first try of Meteor 1.3 and React some months ago. 

If you are interested in the source, it's available on [GitHub](https://github.com/xavcz/dead-or-alive).

If you want to learn more on Meteor 1.3, here is a [study plan to 1.3](https://www.discovermeteor.com/blog/study-plan-meteor-1-3/) by Sacha Greif, author of [Discover Meteor](http://hacklearnmake.com/stoked-on-meteor-discover-meteor/).
