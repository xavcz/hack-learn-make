Are you appealed by mastering the art of real-time web? If yes, the SpaceDojo is a right place where to look. Meaning there are high-quality video courses, podcasts with knowledgeable people & a pro slack room full of web ninjas powered by the same passion, building awesome stuff.

Josh Owens, also the maintainer of [Crater.io](article hack learn make), is the one who has taken [the initiative to gather these resources together](https://thoughts.spacedojo.com/why-i-started-teaching-people-to-write-code-8649ef58456a#.d2up6d39y).

### Learn new coding skills by watching videos
One good way to improve your skills is by attending MOOCs. Josh provides different kind of videos: some short, some extended and some live.

The short ones are code kata. A code kata is a video focused on a particular aspect of programming, like debugging techniques, and go deep on showing you the different ways to handle it. You can find the SpaceDojo’s code kata on its Youtube channel.

The longer ones are real classes, 8-hours prerecorded and available on-demand. This paid-training helps you for understanding better how Meteor works. Moreover, Josh recently updated his classes to explain to you how to couple Meteor with React, Cordova & React Native. These new classes provide a lot of content to have a better comprehension on how the things work under the hood. For your interest, back in the time (3 months ago, things are moving fast out there!), the SpaceDojo was called the Meteor Club.

The live ones are the extended classes but coded live. Spread on two days, and you can watch Josh building an app and ask questions directly. I found amazing to have the opportunity to get back into « school », but remotely and in a much cooler way!

### Stay in the loop of a fast moving ecosystem
Technologies and patterns evolve quickly these days, especially the Javascript world. And as the founder of Free Code Camp said, you should stay in the loop « [if you don’t want to be part of the road](link to please do learn to code) ».

The SpaceDojo Show is a monthly podcast with regular co-hosts and [special guests helping build the web road](link to tweet with Dan Abramov). These guests are people who make our developer life easier and more enjoyable every day. It’s an excellent opportunity to discover, or re-discover, what happened recently in the tech world. And of course, how to handle it in your daily job thanks to you relevant questions and answers.

The podcast is available on any [podcast apps](link to podcast) or [Youtube](link to youtube playlist).

### Hang out with ninjas
After listening and watching, time to chat! The SpaceDojo Slack room is a community full of interesting fellows. I would say one of the best places to get your Meteor and web development questions answered. You can reach there experimented software engineers and help each other. I highly recommend joining the [SpaceDojo community](link to patreon)!
