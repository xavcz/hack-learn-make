We all want to build better Meteor apps which are fast, efficient and easy to manage. This is not a utopia:  [Kadira](https://kadira.io) makes this promise for you. Everyone can manage to reach this point where they are in pure confidence with how they monitor their Meteor app.

### Understand how Meteor works
Such a service may not convince you at first that you need it. After all, you have been doing great so far. 

No bother, but what if I tell you can discover some tricks about the core Meteor you may not have heard? It's time to learn how Meteor works, in an accessible and understandable way thanks to the Bulletproof Meteor course.

BulletProof Meteor covers most of the things you need to know about building a production Meteor app, including:

* Performance
* Best practices
* Database modeling
* Meteor-related architectural patterns

Every lesson is composed of several chapters coming along with a short quizz, skippable, to help you for acknowledging your fresh learnings.

It worth a look and it surely will help you a lot in your daily work, I highly recommend [to check it out](https://bulletproofmeteor.com/basics/introduction) :)
