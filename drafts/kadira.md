We all want to build better Meteor apps which are fast, efficient and easy to manage. This will is not a utopia:  [Kadira](https://kadira.io) makes this promise for you. Everyone can manage to reach this point where they are in pure confidence with how they monitor their Meteor app.

### Understand how Meteor works
Such a service may not convince you at first that you need it. After all, you have been doing great so far. 

No bother, but what if I tell you can discover some tricks about the core Meteor you may not have heard? It's time to learn how Meteor works, in an accessible and understandable way thanks to the Bulletproof Meteor course.

BulletProof Meteor covers most of the things you need to know about building a production Meteor app, including:

* Performance
* Best practices
* Database modeling
* Meteor-related architectural patterns

Every lesson is composed of several chapters coming along with a short quizz, skippable, to help you for acknowledging your new learnings.

It worth a look and it surely will help you a lot in your daily work, I highly recommend [to check it out](https://bulletproofmeteor.com/basics/introduction) :)

### Monitor your app to its depth
>[Kadira Platform](https://kadira.io/platform) helps your team to improve the performance of your app at any stage in its life cycle.

Yep, that's not just a one-use feature. That's a whole platform to make your app bulletproof. Speaking of [bulletproof](https://bulletproofmeteor.com/basics/introduction), the course I described you earlier will help you for getting a grip on the some parts of the platform like **[Kadira Debug](https://kadira.io/platform/kadira-debug/overview)** or **[Kadira APM](https://kadira.io/platform/kadira-apm/overview)**.

These services are great and may change your life, give it a try and you'll see!

### Perform in-depth in every situation
If you want to know more about how the machine works and how to optimize it, I'd recommend reading the articles of [Meteor Performance 101](https://kadira.io/academy/meteor-performance-101).

With all these resources, you know what's going in your app. Now it's time to implement it in your app to *make it faster and make your customers happy* ;)

And, well, huge thanks to the Kadira team and [Arunoda](https://twitter.com/arunoda) for empowering the Meteor community, and even the whole Javascript ecosystem. You can read more about them [on their blog](https://voice.kadira.io/).
