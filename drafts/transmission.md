# Bzzz... Incoming Transmission!

You may be familiar with this sentence when thinking about Meteor. In case you are not, it's an introduction to get information from and with Meteor Development Group, MDG.

### Who is Meteor Development Group?
MDG is the startup behind Meteor. They are the people with the ambition to change the way you build software:

> The new way of writing software should be radically simple. It should make it possible to build a prototype in a day or two, and a real production app in a few weeks. It should make everyday things easy, even when those everyday things involve hundreds of servers, millions of users, and integration with dozens of other systems. It should be built on collaboration, specialization, and division of labor, and it should be accessible to the maximum number of people.

As core builders of Meteor, they are the best placed to give us some crunchy infos about the present and the future of our favorite web technology.

### Read the forums

Speaking about forums and receiving fresh news from the inside, it's seems purely legit to speak about [TRANSMISSION](https://transmission.simplecast.fm/), a weekly podcast / videolog covering the hottest topics to come out of the Meteor Forums.

Each week, [Ben Strahan](https://twitter.com/_benstr) & [Sashko Stubailo](https://twitter.com/stubailo) discuss in deep detail the most relevant forum posts [picked by the community](https://forums.meteor.com/t/satellite-transmission-10-galaxy-hosting-and-package-tracking/19594).

Ben is working at [OK Grow](https://www.okgrow.com/), a web agency focused on creating awesome products, and is also regular cohost at the Crater Podcast. Sashko is core developer at [MDG](http://www.meteor.com). They often invite other people from MDG, like the CEO or other core devs, giving us the opportunity to understand where Meteor is heading to and to get more familiar with the upcoming future which we'll deal with soon...

Listening to TRANSMISSION feels like this:
> Mmmh... What is MDG preparing for us?
